**Abstract:** 
*The problem of pure magnetic detumbling of a fast-tumbling picosatellite is considered. A new weighted B-dot control algorithm is proposed. The algorithm enables power reduction while not sacrificing detumbling performance. Analytical expressions relating the maximal expected rotational rate to the minimum sampling time required are presented. Simulation results demonstrate the practical benefits of the proposed approach for picosatellites.*
